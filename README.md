## Project Description
The Decision Tree Classification model is trained to predict a target variable by learning decision rules from the features in the dataset. This project also includes hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance and visualizes the decision tree structure for interpretability.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation:

* Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Checked and handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Visualized feature distributions using histograms and box plots.
* Generated a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.


3. Feature Engineering:

* Encoded categorical variables using appropriate methods (e.g., Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding).
* Scaled numerical features as needed.

4. Decision Tree Classification:

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
* Implemented a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn.
* Trained and tested the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

* Experimented with hyperparameters like:
* Maximum depth
* Minimum samples split
* Splitting criteria (e.g., Gini Index, Entropy)
* Selected the best configuration based on performance metrics.

6. Model Evaluation:

* Visualized the decision tree structure.
* Analyzed important features that influenced the model predictions.

## Results and Insights
* Key Findings:
* The model achieved an accuracy of [specific value] on the test dataset.
* The most influential features were [list important features based on the tree structure].

## Future Enhancements
* Use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve predictions.
* Experiment with additional feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
